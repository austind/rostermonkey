# RosterMonkey

A PowerShell framework that automates roster syncs from Aeries SIS to cloud-based learning tools

## Overview

RosterMonkey takes (most of) the monkey work out of syncing school rosters, by providing a straighforward way to export SQL queries and upload them.

Back in the day, this was done with one-off batch scripts. These worked well enough because the needs were minimal. These days, federating rosters with lots of third party systems is the new normal. However, a huge gap still exists
